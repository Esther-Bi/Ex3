# Ex3
**Ex3 project**<br>
In this project, we implemented a directed weighted graph, in order to be able to run some algorithms on it.<br>
We used different data structures such as dictionaries to save our data, to optimize our algorithms.<br>
Explanations about the classes can be seen on Wiki.<br>
<br>
We were asked to implement the two following interfaces:<br>
* ***GraphInterface***<br>
This interface represents a directed weighted graph and so it have some functions that change the graph or return information about it.<br>
The interface includes the following functions: <br>
v_size , e_size , get_all_v, all_in_edges_of_node , all_out_edges_of_node , get_mc , , add_edge , add_node , remove_node , remove_edge.<br>
More information can be seen on Wiki.<br>
* ***GraphAlgoInterface***<br>
This interface represents a directed weighted graph that is runnable with other functions.<br>
The interface includes the following functions: <br>
get_graph  , shortest_path , centerPoint , TSP , save_to_json , load_from_json , plot_graph.<br>
More information can be seen on Wiki.<br>
<br>
Below are the some of the graphs we have created using our plotting function:<br>
